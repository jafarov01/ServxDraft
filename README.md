## General Info

The purpose of Servx is to create a user-friendly digital platform that connects service providers with seekers, streamlining the service industry. It allows providers to list and promote their services, while seekers can easily find and compare offerings. The platform incorporates a rating and review system to help users make informed decisions. The current focus is on developing the iOS mobile application, with plans for future expansion to Android and launching Servx as a startup.

The target audience includes a wide range of service providers and seekers, from independent freelancers to small businesses, and homeowners, tenants, and business owners. Servx aims to modernize service advertising and attract tech-savvy individuals looking for efficient ways to access and provide services.

The overall structure of the Servx app consists of five main screens: Home, Bookings, Calendar, Inbox, and Profile. The Home Screen provides an overview of service categories, recommendations, and bookmarked services. The Bookings Screen centralizes service appointments management, the Calendar Screen offers a visual representation of the user's schedule, and the Inbox Screen facilitates direct communication between providers and seekers. The Profile Screen allows users to personalize their experience and manage essential details. Each screen is designed to enhance user experience and efficiency in accessing, managing, and utilizing services on the platform.
